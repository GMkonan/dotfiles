### Konan dotfiles (always wip)
config is for general .config stuff. Rest of general dotfiles is on base while target specific are divided in directories (nix, mac, devcontainer)

### Mac
mainly installing using brew (brewfile)

### Nix
Using flakes
(still have to pass stuff from my laptop to here tho)

### Devcontainer
completely WIP but will probably just borrow my terminal config in a minimalistic way

### General terminal stuff
- kitty (details on kitty.conf but colorscheme = catppuccin and font = Jetbrains Mono)
- zsh
- zoxide
- lsd
- fzf (+ ripgrep)
- nvim using lazy (nvim config included, based on kickstart.nvim)
- tmux
- lazy docker (tui)

### TODO
- change PS1
- ascii image of my pixel art?
- change zsh theme (currently using the p10k)
