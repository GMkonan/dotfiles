# Konan dotfiles (always wip)
config is for general .config stuff. Rest of general dotfiles is on base while target specific are divided in directories (nix, mac, devcontainer)

### Mac
mainly installing using brew (brewfile)

### Flake (NixOS)
Using flakes (very early stages)

### Devcontainer
completely WIP but will probably just borrow my terminal config in a minimalistic way

### General terminal stuff
- kitty (details on kitty.conf but colorscheme = catppuccin and font = Jetbrains Mono)
- zsh
- oh-my-posh (custom theme inside zsh/)
- zoxide
- lsd
- fzf (+ ripgrep)
- nvim using lazy (nvim config included, based on kickstart.nvim)
- tmux
- lazy docker (tui)

### Nvim
My neovim config is here but since it's a bigger configuration it has it's own readme you can look it up

### TODO
- ascii image of my pixel art?
- toggle on and off opacity to show and not show image (yabai?)
- change cd to z from zoxide
- change more of the p10k zsh config
- nvim fix config for Nix
- change bottom bars (nvim and tmux)
- install automatically Determinate Systemâ€™s Nix Installer for the shell

### ideas
- Nix
    - rofi (wind and app manager)
    - window tiling manager (hyperland and sway)
    - astal
    - dunst

- mac
    - yabai
    - simple-bar
