- Make vscode sync automatically after install?
- add extensions to google-chrome automatically
- install a font and use in terminal via command line ubuntu

### Problems

- nvm
- spotify sudo

### Ideas

- install tandem
- install nerd font
- sync visual studio code automatically
- google extensions? (maybe just logging is enough)
  - extensions: 1pass, adblock, dark reader, languagetool
- Install other zsh plugins (1pass)

#### Things I do outside of script

Somethings that I do when setting up a new PC that are not included in the script:

- Download any more complicated to install apps
- Download fonts (Jetbrain mono is a good one)
