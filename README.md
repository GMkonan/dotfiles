## Debian based Dotfiles

Hey! I format my PC a lot and it's so boring to reconfig everything every time to start working... So I automated! Right now it will only work on debian based distros (use of apt and etc) but if you use other OS you can still take a look on some general configs like my `zshrc` files and what plugins I use, a took a lot of inspiration from dotfiles that were made for MacOS so you can do the same here if you want ðŸ˜€

### Ideas ðŸš€

- multi-dotfiles (Would love to have a setup that works for Linux, macos and Windows WSL)

### Todo...?

I don't always do what is in the todo list... ðŸ¥²

- Test if everything is working
- Install other zsh plugins (1pass, tmuxinator, tmux-resurrect)
- Install [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation) (figure best way to automate)
- Install [exa](https://the.exa.website/#installation)
- Update tmux.conf
- Install [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (Will only install if I test it and like it)
- Configure LunarVim (how to symlink efficiently?) https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/configuration

#### Things I do outside of script

Somethings that I do when setting up a new PC that are not included in the script:

- Download any more complicated to install apps
- Download fonts (Jetbrain mono is a good one) (want to automate that)
- Run `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf` Inside a tmux session to load configs
